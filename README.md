# Legacy NshIS website
You can visit it right now. [click here](https://legacy.nshis.com/). Since I don't maintain it anymore, I decided to make it public.

There are some API keys ðŸ‘€ somewhere in the code, but they are revoked so like cool.

Also, there were so many commits because I didn't know how to use GitHub and Vercel, so I committed every single thing I changed. ðŸ˜­
