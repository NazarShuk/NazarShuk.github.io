         <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; opacity: 25%;">11/6/2023</h4>
         <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Time</h1>
         <p>I was bored once, so i decided to make a new page. I called it "Time". It just showed the current time in the center of the screen.
             Nothing interesting.</p>

         <iframe  width="100%" height="400px" src="firstTime.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>And i also thought that was boring, so...</p>
     </div>
     <div id="slide2" class="slide">
         <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; opacity: 25%;">11/17/2023</h4>
         <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">The "RC"</h1>
         <p>Even i dont remember what i meant by "RC", but thats how it was called in the files. The first ever version was just... well uhm... take a look:</p>
         <iframe  width="100%" height="400px" src="rc.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>Thats... something. Lets just skip some commits...</p>
         <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="rc2.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>That looks something like the schedule now (if you ignore the negative values). It is the last commit i found of the "RC". After that, i deleted the page, and started doing something else. sad</p>
     </div>
     
     <div id="slide3" class="slide">
     
     <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; opacity: 25%;">11/20/2023</h4>
     <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">The Humble Beginnings</h1>
     <p>3 days later, i decided to ctrl+z the deleted "RC" page, and rename it to "Schedule". I actually decided to focus on making the schedule this time, and not something else. Here is how it looked back then.</p>
     <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="schedule1.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
     <p>DO YOU SEE THAT?!?!?! THE NAMES...ARE SHOWN!!!!! NO WAY!!!1!11.</p>
     <p>But actually, it is basically the same as it was before, you can even see the date i hard coded on the "RC" version.</p>
     <p>Lets skip some commits again...</p>
     <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="schedule2.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
     <p>It actually works now! No way. As you can see, the date is now updated, and all of the periods are there. Yes, they were called periods. And, if you are reading this before 8:15 AM, you can see that the time actually works before the first item. That doesnt work in the current version (150). </p>
     <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="schedule1.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
     <p>going further...</p>
     <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="schedule3.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
     <p>That looks even more like schedule today. You can see the items in the corner. But for some reason in this specific version, the countdown is not shown ðŸ’€.</p>
     
     <p>After this, i didnt update my whole website for a few weeks, sad.</p>
     </div>
     
     <div id="slide4" class="slide">
         <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; opacity: 25%;">12/14/2023</h4>
         <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Looking more like it</h1>
         <p>After i finally came back, i deployed a new update for it. It was just a few UI changes, nothing else.</p>
         <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="new1.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>The first opacity changes are finally here, after that i used them all over my website.</p>
         <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="new2.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>This is one of the most important updates of the history. It introduced the main animation. The odometer.js. Now, when i looked at this page, i was actually satisfied, and not asking what am i doing with my life.</p>
         <p>Oh and yeah the items now dont say the current date, only the time. And o7 for the hours number.</p>
         <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="new3.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>I skipped over a few updates, because they added small things. As of the time writing this (3/31/2024) this update was released 100 days ago. It introduced: blue flashing text, loading text, new css link, and the most important: <a href="../josh.png">josh.png</a>, my favourite thing.</p>
         <p>This is also the time, one of my friends started using it, thats how it got where it is today.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 10px;">By the way, the new css link broke the whole design of the page Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>

     </div>
     <div id="slide5" class="slide">
         <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; opacity: 25%;">1/25/2023</h4>
         <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">People are using it?!</h1>
         <p>At that time, i think 2+ people were using it, so now, i changed my thoughts on what to add, now actually listening to the consumers over my ideas. Here is the first thing they asked me to add</p>
         <p style="font-size: 10px;">From now on, i will be changing the css link for the page to render properly. Thats the only code i will change.</p>
         <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="popular1.html" style="background-color: white"></iframe>
         <p>If you look in the bottom right corner, you will see a text. Its a countdown until weekend. Yes, thats what the people using the schedule wanted.</p>
